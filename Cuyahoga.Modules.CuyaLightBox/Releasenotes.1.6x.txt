CuyaLighBox release notes
===========================================================================
1.6.0 - 2009-05-11
===========================================================================
This is the first release. There are still some features to be added and some  
cleaning up/refactoring to do. 

CuyaLighBox is a basic module that makes it easy to add LighBoxes to your Cuyahoga site.

Features:
- Create multiple LighBoxes
- Upload images to the selected LighBox
- Automatic thumbnail creation
- Basic editing of added LightBox and LightBoxImage data

Improvements:
- None yet! It is the first release :), but some are still on the 'to do' list. Like  
image file deletion and fixing the registration of the JavaScripts to enable multiple section instances in one node and some validation maybe. Any ideas for improvements? - just email.

Bugfixes:
- send bug finds to john@novocreations.com or post on the forum

This was actually built using a slightly customised (but still core and module compatible) and then briefly tested with Cuyahoga 1.6.


Known Issues:

Cuyahoga 1.6

There was an issue with the registration of JavaScripts. Inside the 'BaseModuleControl.cs' the method 'RegisterJavascript(string key, string absoluteJavaScriptPath)' seemed to be named 'RegisterJavaScript' Capital S in script. So I changed it. Since I added the register javascript and css methods and then submitted them for inclusion in the build there was a slight difference. I will amend my version to the released version.
